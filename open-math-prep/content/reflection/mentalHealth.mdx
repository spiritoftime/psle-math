### Introduction

The world is dogshit. You have jobs & internships demanding 10000YOE, causing everyone to have to play the race to the bottom - a fast track management associate leadership program towards burnout and depression. You will never think you are good enough. It appears that in the process, many of us have forgotten the joy of just learning something new.

### About Me

I'm a final year biz undergrad and bootcamp graduate (I'm damn sure some of you raised an eyebrow from this). Currently I'm aspiring to be a SWE. So you can trust that the following yap session is coming from someone who probably can empathise with your pain, despite our different aspirations.

### Stop giving a shit about other people's perception of you

Nobody will ever have the impression you are trying to convey. Here's an example. <br/>

I honestly thought me being a bootcamp grad was a plus. I juggled a 5 mod semester with doing the bootcamp and tried my best to tinker with personal projects way beyond whatever was taught. I thought it would show I'm a hard worker and I have a passion for programming. <br/>

It didnt help at all. I've met a lot of kind people, but I've also gotten ick stares the moment I mention I'm a bootcamper. My resume has gone down the toilet god knows how many times because probably only 0.01% of recruiters get the impression I'm trying to convey in my one-page resume. When I start actively looking for jobs as I near graduation, I'm probably just removing the whole part altogether. <br/>

In another context, this means you should just do whatever you think is right and dont let other people's opinion weigh on you too much. If you have to take a break and not spam internship or leetcode, then do it.

### Form a genuine interest in whatever it is that you do

Now you have tried to stop caring about other people's opinion. But you still hate your life. You are stuck doing miserable stuff like leetcoding, doing TYS or whatever to secure a better future. I can't tell you how much I relate to this. <br/><br/>
One moment I would be happy - yay I unblocked myself from a coding problem and am one stop closer to finishing my appblocker application! The very next moment impostor syndrome and crap hits me and I'm back to being a miserable derp.

I am still/ have struggled with this. It's like a toxic relationship - I love learning but learning is killing me mentally.<br/>

Some of you might be in a field you think you are not interested in. I get it - ever since I started programming I have been questioning myself - "Why am I even in business? It's so useless." I didn't want to switch degrees and extend my graduation date, but I've disliked my degree for a long while.

My mentality has started to change since I started this side project, and because I'm now taking strategy under a great prof. I'm starting to form my own opinion and am trying to understand how tech and non-tech can help me practically. Class is now more enjoyable because I'm starting to rid myself of the thought that business is a trash degree, and I'm actually trying my best to absorb knowledge from my biz classes. Now I'mma yolo and make this site.

### I don't have a "real" interest

For most people, you do. You are working hard in your own area and have stuck to it for a long time. Chances are you forgot how to just "enjoy the moment", because you worked too hard.

At the start of the year, ChatGPT started to explode in popularity and it sent me to a ridiculous existential crisis. I tried to push on and continue juggling programming on the side, my business modules and internship hunting. I got so burnt out all I could do was manmode - go to class then spend the entire day sleeping away. My advice would be to take a breather - for me this burnout lasted all the way till summer holidays, before coding the appblocker got me to love learning again.

Exploring new things probably helps. For me, I was initially forced to do so - we have to clear 80hours of community service to graduate. That's where I got the inspiration to make the initial concept of this site - a site for PSLE math. Now, the strategy class is giving me ideas and I'm considering to make this a blog/social enterprise focusing on what I think education should be.

### Conclusion

I don't have a perfect answer for how you can improve your own life because I don't know you (nor will I have the "correct" impression of you). I'm not perfect and am also struggling - I'm one of those antisocial guys who just walk out the class at the end of the semester, when my groupmates want to take photos together. There were multiple times I ghosted people simply because I just simply didnt have any mental capacity/ energy to even bother to read messages. But I hope my perspective is giving you ideas on how to take care of yourself and hopefully this yap is useful
