  The tldr for this concept is that amongst the 2 ratios, someone is repeated.
</p>
To solve: 1. Expand the ratio to include the repeated person. 2. Make the ratio
of the repeated person the same 3. Find the answer.

They can make it slightly more tricky for you to know what is the repeated identity.
Eg:

1. Ratio 1 - Children and Adults are 5:6.
2. Ratio 2 - Boys and Girls are 2:1.
3. The repeated identity is children, since children is made up of boys and girls.
