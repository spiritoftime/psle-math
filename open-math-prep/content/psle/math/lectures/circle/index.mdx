## Circle Formulas

### Basic Circle

| Property      | Formula      | Variables                                   |
| ------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Radius        | r            | r = radius                                  |
| Diameter      | d = 2r       | d = diameter, r = radius                    |
| Circumference | C = 2πr = πd | C = circumference, r = radius, d = diameter |
| Area          | A = πr²      | A = area, r = radius                        |

### Quadrant (Quarter Circle)

| Property   | Formula                  | Variables                               |
| ---------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Arc Length | L = (1/4) × 2πr = (π/2)r | L = arc length, r = radius              |
| Area       | A = (1/4) × πr²          | A = area, r = radius                    |
| Perimeter  | P = (1/4) × πd + 2r      | P = perimeter, r = radius, d = diameter |

### Semicircle (Half Circle)

| Property  | Formula         | Variables                               |
| --------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Diameter  | d               | d = diameter of full circle             |
| Perimeter | P = πr + d      | P = perimeter, r = radius, d = diameter |
| Area      | A = (1/2) × πr² | A = area, r = radius                    |

Note:

- π (pi) is approximately equal to 3.14159
- For more precise calculations, use more decimal places of π or keep π as a symbol in your calculator

There are two main types of composite figures.
