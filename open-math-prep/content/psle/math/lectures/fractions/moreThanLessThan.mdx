#### How to spot the question type:

1. As the name suggests, the question usually has a lot of "more than" and "less than" phrases.
2. To solve it, you can use the model method, or use algebra (recommended).
3. Basically, you slice the model up into the fractions, then make the remaining parts equal. Please refer to equal fractions again if unclear!
