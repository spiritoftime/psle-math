import { Callout } from "fumadocs-ui/components/callout";

#### How to spot the question type:

1. Normally, there is an unknown combination of items. There is not enough info to form any ratio/fraction/algebra.
2. You often need to group the items together, and employ a bit of guess and check to reach the answer.
