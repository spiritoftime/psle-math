### Question 1

<Callout title="Question">
  Ali and John went on a trip together with the same amount of money. Ali spent
  8 dollars everyday and John spent 5 dollars every day. Ali had 12 dollars in
  the end while John had 24 dollars in the end. How much did each person have at
  first?

    <p className="ml-11">Ans: Each person had $52 at first</p>
    <div className="steps">
      <div className="step">
        <h3>Let d be the number of days spent on the trip</h3>
        Let x be the initial amount of money each person had. <br></br> For Ali:
        $x - 8d = 12$ <br></br> For John: $x - 5d = 24$
      </div>
      <div className="step">
        <h3>Equate the two expressions</h3>
        $x - 8d = 12$ <br></br> $x - 5d = 24$ <br></br> Subtracting these equations:
        $-3d = -12$
      </div>
      <div className="step">
        <h3>Solve for d</h3>
        $d = 4$ The trip lasted 4 days.
      </div>
      <div className="step">
        <h3>Substitute d back into either equation</h3>
        Using Ali's equation: $x - 8(4) = 12$ <br></br> $x - 32 = 12$ <br></br> $x
        = 44 $
      </div>
      <div className="step">
        <h3>Verify the solution</h3>
        For Ali: $44 - 8(4) = 12$ <br></br> For John: $44 - 5(4) = 24$ <br></br>
        The difference between their final amounts is indeed $32 - 20 = 12$, as
        stated in the question.
