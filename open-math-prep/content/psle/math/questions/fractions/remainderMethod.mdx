  <h3>Using the Remainder Method</h3>
  <BranchDiagram data={remainderMethodQuestion1BranchData} />
</div>
<div className="step">
    <h3>Calculating the Fraction of Money Left</h3>
    - After buying books: 1 - 3/5 = 2/5 of the money remained
    - After buying the wallet: 2/3 of 2/5 remained
    - Fraction of money left = 2/3 × 2/5 = 4/15
  </div>
  <div className="step">
    <h3>Calculating the Fraction of Money Left</h3>
    - 4 units = 16 dollars
    - 1 unit = 16 ÷ 4 = 4
    - 15 units = 4 × 15 = 60
  </div>

  <div className="step">
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    John had $60 at first.
