## Equal Intervals

### Question 1

  <Accordion title="Question">
    <QuestionWithImage

    />
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Answer Walkthrough">

<div className="steps">
  <div className="step">
    <h3>Part (a): Complete the table for Figure 4</h3>
    <p>Number of triangles: $4 \times 2 = 8$</p>
    <p>Number of sticks: $22 + 7 = 29$</p>
    <p>
      The pattern increases by 2 triangles and 7 sticks for each new figure.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div className="step">
    <h3>Part (b): Find the Figure Number with 2507 sticks</h3>
    <p>Number of sticks in Figure 1: $8$</p>
    <p>Increase in sticks per figure: $7$</p>
    <p>Equation: $8 + 7(n - 1) = 2507$, where $n$ is the Figure Number</p>
    <p>Solving for $n$: $7n - 7 + 8 = 2507$</p>
    <p>$7n = 2506$</p>
    <p>
      $n = \frac{2506}
      {7} = 358$
    </p>
  </div>
  <div className="step">
    <h3>Final Answer</h3>
    <p>(a) Figure 4: 8 triangles, 29 sticks</p>
    <p>(b) Figure Number with 2507 sticks: 358</p>
  </div>
