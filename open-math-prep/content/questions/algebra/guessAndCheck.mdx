## Setting Up Equations with One Variable

### Question 1

<Callout title="Question">
  <h4 className="my-0">Tom packed 5 balls into each bag and found that he had 8 balls left over. If he packed 7 balls into each bag, he would need another 4 more balls.  </h4>

  <br></br> <p className="my-0">a: How many bags did he have?</p> <br></br> <p className="my-0">b: How many balls did he have altogether? ?</p>
</Callout>
<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Answer Walkthrough">
    <p className="ml-11">Ans: a: 6 bags, b: 38 balls</p>
    <div className="steps">
      <div className="step">
        <h3>Let x be the number of bags</h3>
        When Tom packs 5 balls into each bag, he has 8 balls left over. This means:
        $5x + 8 =$ Total number of balls
      </div>
      <div className="step">
        <h3>Consider the scenario with 7 balls per bag</h3>
        In this case, he would need 4 more balls. This means: $7x - 4 =$ Total number
        of balls
      </div>
      <div className="step">
        <h3>Equate the two expressions</h3>
        $5x + 8 = 7x - 4$
      </div>
      <div className="step">
        <h3>Solve for x</h3>
        $2x = 12$ $x = 6$
      </div>
      <div className="step">
        <h3>Find the total number of balls</h3>
        When $x = 6$, the total number of balls is: $5x + 8 = 5(6) + 8 = 38$ <br></br>{" "}
        or $7x- 4 = 7(6) - 4 = 38$

## Setting Up Equations with One Variable and Adjustments

### Question 1

<Callout title="Question">
  Miss Lee bought some pencils for her class of 8 students. Each girl received 5
  pencils and each boy received 2 pencils. She bought a total of 22 pencils. How
  many boys were there in the class?
</Callout>
<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Answer Walkthrough">
    <p className="ml-11">Ans: 6 boys</p>
    <div className="steps">
      <div className="step">
        <h3>Let g be the number of girls</h3>
        Since there are 8 students in total, the number of boys will be $8 - g$.
      </div>
      <div className="step">
        <h3>Set up the equation</h3>
        Total pencils = (Pencils per girl × Number of girls) + (Pencils per boy ×
        Number of boys) $22 = 5g + 2(8 - g)$
      </div>
      <div className="step">
        <h3>Simplify the equation</h3>
        $22 = 5g + 16 - 2g$<br></br> $22 = 3g + 16$
      </div>
      <div className="step">
        <h3>Solve for g</h3>
        $6 = 3g$<br></br> $g = 2$
      </div>
      <div className="step">
        <h3>Calculate the number of boys</h3>
        Number of boys = $8 - g = 8 - 2 = 6$
      </div>
      <div className="step">
        <h3>Verify the solution</h3>2 girls × 5 pencils each = 10<br></br> pencils
        6 boys × 2 pencils each = 12 pencils <br></br>Total pencils = $10 + 12 =
        22$, which matches the given information.

## Double Ifs

<Callout type="warn" title="Note">
  As you will see in the solutions there's quite a bit of simultaneous equations
  and variables needed. Might wanna see ratio
</Callout>
### Question 1

<Callout title="Question">
  <h4 className="my-0">
    A farmer has some chickens and ducks. If he sells 2 chickens and 3 ducks
    every day, there will be 50 chickens left when all the ducks have been sold.
    If he sells 3 chickens and 2 ducks every day, there will be 25 chickens left
    when all the ducks have been sold.

    <div className="steps">
      <div className="step">
        <h3>Define variables</h3>
        Let x be the number of days in the first scenario,  
        Let y be the number of days in the second scenario,        <br></br>
        Let c be the initial number of chickens,        <br></br>
        Let d be the initial number of ducks,
      </div>
      <div className="step">
        <h3>Set up equations for both scenarios</h3>
        Scenario 1: $c - 2x = 50$ and $d - 3x = 0$        <br></br>
        Scenario 2: $c - 3y = 25$ and $d - 2y = 0$
      </div>
      <div className="step">
        <h3>Solve for x and y in terms of d</h3>
        From scenario 1: $x = d/3$<br></br>
        From scenario 2: $y = d/2$
      </div>
      <div className="step">
        <h3>Substitute these into the chicken equations</h3>
        Scenario 1: $c - 2(d/3) = 50$<br></br>
        Scenario 2: $c - 3(d/2) = 25$
      </div>
      <div className="step">
        <h3>Equate these expressions</h3>
        $c - 2d/3 = c - 3d/2 + 25$<br></br>
        $-2d/3 = -3d/2 + 25$<br></br>
        $5d/6 = 25$<br></br>
        $d = 30$
      </div>
      <div className="step">
        <h3>Solve for c</h3>
        Substitute $d = 30$ into either equation:<br></br>
        $c - 2(30/3) = 50$<br></br>
        $c - 20 = 50$<br></br>
        $c = 70$
      </div>
      <div className="step">
        <h3>Final answer</h3>
        a: There are 30 ducks<br></br>
        b: There are 70 chickens
