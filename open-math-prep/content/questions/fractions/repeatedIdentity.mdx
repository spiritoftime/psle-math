    <p className="ml-11">Ans: 110</p>
    <div className="steps">
      <div className="step">
        <h3>Initial Ratios (Make something the same)</h3>
        The repeated identity is **children**.
        <div className="flex flex-wrap space-between">
          <EqualPartPieChartComponent
            title={"Children in 1st ratio"}
            slices={6}
          />
          <EqualPartPieChartComponent
            title={"Children in 2nd ratio"}
            slices={3}
          />
        </div>
        Adults : Children = $5 : 6$
        <br /> Boys : Girls : Children = $2 : 1 : 3 = 4 : 2 : 6$ (Make the
        children the same)
      </div>
      <div className="step">
        <h3>Difference between Adults and Boys</h3>
        <p>$5u - 4u = 1u$</p>
        $1u = 10$
      </div>
      <div className="step">
        <h3>Calculating Total People</h3>
        $11u = 110$ (Ans)
      </div>
    </div>
    Therefore, there are 110 people inside the room.
