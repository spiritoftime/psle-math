#### Question 1

<Callout title="Question">
  James had 120 more marbles than Dan. After James lost 1/5 of his marbles and
  Dan lost 3/4 of his marbles, James had 184 more marbles than Dan. How many
  marbles did Dan have at first?

        <h3>Initially</h3>
        Let D be the number of marbles Dan has at first. Since James had 120 more marbles than Dan, James had $D + 120$ marbles.
      </div>
 <div className="step">
    <h3>After Losing Marbles</h3>
    James lost $\frac{1}{5}$ of his marbles, so he had $\frac{4}{5}$ of his initial marbles left: $\frac{4}{5} \times (D + 120)$.

    Dan lost $\frac{3}{4}$ of his marbles, so he had $\frac{1}{4}$ of his initial marbles left: $\frac{1}{4} \times D$.

    After losing marbles, James had 184 more marbles than Dan: $\frac{4}{5} \times (D + 120) = \frac{1}{4} \times D + 184$.

    <h3>Solving the Problem</h3>
    $\frac{4}{5} \times (D + 120) = \frac{1}{4} \times D + 184$

    To solve this, we first clear the fractions by multiplying through by 20:

    $16(D + 120) = 5D + 3680$

    Expand and simplify:

    $16D + 1920 = 5D + 3680$

    Isolate $D$:

    $16D - 5D = 3680 - 1920$

    $11D = 1760$

    $D = 160$

    Dan had 160 marbles initially.
