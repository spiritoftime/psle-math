Welcome! Don't worry, there is no shilling, mlm or anything ^^. <br />
All Content is based on my interpretation of Fundamentals of Corporate Finance, 2/e
textbook. <br /> I don't know what exactly we will learn yet (taking this module!), but
I'm sure everyone has pondered about finance in their life at least once. So buckle
up, and lets enjoy learning together!

### Why study corporate finance?

Say you want to buy hdb rooms and rent/sell them out. There will be some questions you need to ask:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    How can I get the money needed to start the business? Do I lend from ahlong,
    bank or do you want to bring in other investors to pool the money needed?
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Should I accept cash or maybe add Stripe for the rent? If you accept cash,
    you can get the money immediately. If you use Stripe, it will take business
    days before the money goes to your wallet, but it will make it more
    convenient for customers.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Is your business sustainable? Will you end up bankrupt from being unable to
    pay the person renovating the room, etc? Is there enough cash flow?
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Financial manager/ agent ideally working in owner interests

Normally, the owner is usually not involved in making business decisions, they hire a financial manager to make decisions for them. We refer to the manager as an agent. The agent is concerned with 3 types of questions:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Capital Budgeting:** How should the business invest its money in the long
    term? The agent decides which projects or assets the business should invest
    in to generate profits. For example, should the company buy new machinery to
    produce goods faster, or should it open a new store in a different location?
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Capital Structure:** How to get the money needed for your business? The
    agent chooses the best mix of debt (like loans) and equity (like selling
    shares) to fund the business. For instance, should the company take a loan
    from the bank to expand, or should it raise money by selling some of its
    shares to investors?
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Working Capital Management:** How should the business manage its daily
    operations? The agent ensures the company has enough cash to cover
    short-term expenses like paying suppliers, employees, and utility bills. An
    example is deciding whether to keep more money in the bank for emergencies
    or to use it to buy more inventory to meet customer demand.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Now ideally, the agent would be working in the best interests of the owner - often
profit/ stock prices. However, there might be **_agency problem_** - where the agent's
interest dont align with the owner.

<Callout title="Example" type="info">
  An agent might decide to retain more employees than necessary (maybe friends?)
  to ensure job security and maintain a good relationship with the workforce,
  even if it reduces profitability. This decision might conflict with the
  owner's interest in maximizing profits by reducing costs.
</Callout>

**To prevent agency problem**:

1. **Aligning Interests**: Ensure managerial interests align with those of owners through performance-based incentives like bonuses, stock options, or profit-sharing.

2. **Firm Control**: Implement mechanisms allowing shareholders to remove directors who are not acting in the best interest of the owners, ensuring accountability and alignment with shareholder goals.

### What type of business should I be?

| **Business Type**       | **Advantages**                                                                                                                    | **Disadvantages**                                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sole Proprietorship** | Easiest to start, Least regulated, Single owner keeps all the profits, Taxed once as personal income                              | Limited to life of owner, Equity capital limited to owner's personal wealth, Unlimited liability, Difficult to sell ownership interest                         |
| **Partnership**         | Two or more owners, More capital available, Relatively easy to start, Income taxed once as personal income                        | Unlimited liability (General partnership, Limited partnership), Partnership dissolves when one partner dies or wishes to sell, Difficult to transfer ownership |
| **Corporation**         | Limited liability, Unlimited life, Separation of ownership and management, Transfer of ownership is easy, Easier to raise capital | Double taxation (income taxed at the corporate rate and then dividends taxed at the personal rate)                                                             |

<Callout title="Personal Interpretation" type="info">
  I think maybe proprietorship/ partnership would be great for just starting
  out, since you keep more profit and less barrier to entry. When you want to
  sell the company or prevent your main business from being impacted by a risky
  venture, maybe try corporation?

**_The financial market has two types of markets:_**

<Steps>
  <Step>
    <strong>Primary Market:</strong> Original sale of securities. For example,
    government selling off bonds. This is where new securities are first issued
    and sold to investors.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <strong>Secondary Market:</strong> Further exchange of securities after
    their initial issuance. Examples include: - Stockholder-to-stockholder
    transactions - Trading at stock exchanges The main function of the secondary
    market is to provide a means of transferring ownership of securities.
  </Step>
