<Callout title="Why Learn this?" type="info">
  1. You might buy some insurance investment plan where they give you payout for
  X years. <br />
  2. probably useful for stonk analysis? idk havent learn yet

### Discounted and Compounded Value

As long as you understand discount (in supermarket/taobao whatever) you should be able to understand this. A future cash flow (in this case cash flow just means future money you receive) needs to be discounted to find the present value (how much this investment is currently worth). This is because over the years the investment will increase by simple/compound interest per last lecture.

A present value of investment needs to be compounded to find the future value.

Eg: \$1000 dollars investment, 5% yearly compound interest. Your present value of investment is \$1000. It needs to be compounded (1000 \* (1+0.05) = \$1050) to get the future value ($1050).

We will be using Excel to solve subsequent questions. If you dont have excel, please feel free to use Google Sheets.

  Suppose you are looking at the following possible cash flows:   <br />

1.Year 1 CF =$100; <br />

2.Years 2 and 3 CFs = $200; <br />

3.Years 4 and 5 CFs = $300. <br />

The required discount rate is 7%. What is the value of the cash flows at year
5?

</Callout>
Hint: At year 1, your pmt (in years) is 4. Your interest rate is same as discount rate, 7%. How much is the future value of Year 1 CF?
<Accordions>

  <Accordion title="Answer Walkthrough">
  You can absolutely use the FV values to solve this question. 
    1. Year 1 CF- \$100 * (1+0.07) ^ 4 = \$131.08 
    2. Year 2 and 3 CF- \$200 * (1+0.07) ^ 3 = \$245.01 and \$200 * (1+0.07) ^ 2 = \$228.98
    3. Year 4 and 5 - \$300 * (1+0.07) ^ 1 = \$245.01 and \$300 * (1+0.07) ^ 0 = \$300
    4. Sum them up - \$1201.99
    <Callout title="Why is PMT 4 in Year 1 for example?" type="info">

You dont get compound interest in the first year. eg: your stonk only pays you dividend etc after a year of holding it for example

<Callout title="Question Time!" type="info">
  1. What is the value of the cash flows today? <br />
  2. What is the value of the cash flows at year 3?
</Callout>

<Accordions>

  <Accordion title="Answer Walkthrough">
1. You calculated future value of cash flows at Year 5. Now calculate PV (present value). 
$$
\$1201.99 \div (1+0.07)^5 = \$874.121
$$
2. Sum of FV at year 3 = 107+245+228.98 = 580.98 (Whatever you have already received at Year 3 - Year 1,2,3 Cash Flow)
$$
\$580.98 \div (1+0.07)^3 = \$474.292
$$

Lets try a few more finance questions~

<Callout title="Question Time!" type="info">
  You want to receive 5,000 per month in retirement. If you can earn 0.75% per
  month and you expect to need the income for 25 years, how much do you need to
  have in your account at retirement?
</Callout>

<Accordions>

  <Accordion title="Answer Walkthrough">

     1. PMT (payment received per month) is 5000<br/>
     2. Future Value is 0 - you dont get a lump sum in the end of 25 years
     3. Your monthly interest rate is 0.75% Yearly is 9% (0.75% x 12)
     4. Your nper (amount of months) is 300 (25 years x 12 months per year)
     5. You can use the PV formula to calculate. You end up with -$595,808.11
