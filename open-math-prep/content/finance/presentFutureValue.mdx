<Callout title="Why Learn this?" type="info">
  1. You will be able to plan your retirement; how much money you need <br />
  2. If you want to take out a loan, buy investment plan, you can calculate if it
  makes sense to do it.

### Types of interest

1. Simple interest - it is a fixed sum of money you will get based on your initial investment.
   eg: 4% simple interest yearly on your initial investment of $1000. How much interest is earned after 5 years?

   $$
   \begin{aligned}
   I &= 1000 \times 0.04 \times 5 = 200 \text{ dollars}
   \end{aligned}
   $$

   Formula:

   $$
   I = P \times r \times t
   $$

   1. I = Interest earned (the total amount of interest accrued)
   2. P = Principal (the initial investment amount)
   3. r = Annual interest rate (expressed as a decimal)
   4. t = Time (the number of years the amount is invested)<br/>

2. **_Compound Interest_** <br/>
   The formula:

   $$
   \begin{aligned}
   FV &= PV(1 + r)^t \\
   \text{where:} \\
   FV &= \text{future value} \\
   PV &= \text{present value} \\
   r &= \text{period interest rate (as decimal)} \\
   t &= \text{number of periods}
   \end{aligned}
   $$

   1. Present Value is the current value - eg. your bank account current sum.<br/>
   2. Future Value is how much your bank account may have in the future, since bank gives you interest (though close to negligible) <br/>
   3. Interest rate is basically how much you would profit. <br/>
   4. Number of periods can be in months, years days, whatever

Couple things to note before we proceed:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    pv and fv have opposite signs - negative is an outflow (money leaves you)
    and positive is inflow (you get money).
  </Step>
  <Step>
    PV, FV whatever can be positive or negative - just make sure they have
    opposite signs. pmt (payment per period) is same sign as FV.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Typically, we let PV be negative (you are spending money on an investment).
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout title="Question Time!" type="info">
  In a recent survey by SingLife, respondents opined that they expect to have
  saved SGD 612000 for retirement at 65 years old. They also said they expect to
  use SGD 2856 a month - the SGD 612000 will be used finished by the time they
  reach 85. Suppose now they plan to retire at 65 and they have to fund
  retirement till 85 years, what is the implied annual rate of interest they
  would need?

We will be using Excel to solve it. If you dont have excel, please feel free to use Google Sheets. You can try using the following functions:

- [RATE](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/rate-function-9f665657-4a7e-4bb7-a030-83fc59e748ce) - Calculates the interest rate per period of an annuity
- [NPER](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/nper-function-240535b5-6653-4d2d-bfcf-b6a38151d815) - Calculates the number of periods for an investment
- [PV](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/pv-function-23879d31-0e02-4321-be01-da16e8168cbd) - Calculates the present value of an investment
- [FV](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/fv-function-2eef9f44-a084-4c61-bdd8-4fe4bb1b71b3) - Calculates the future value of an investment

<Accordions>

  <Accordion title="Answer Walkthrough">
    1. Let PV be -612000.<br/> 
    2. PMT (Payment per month) will be 2856.<br/>
     3. Nper (Number of periods) is 240 months.<br/> 
     4. Future Value is 0 - you used up all your retirement funds at 85 years

     You can use the RATE Function To calculate. Because your Nper is in months, you end up with the monthly interest (0.0959%). Yearly interest is 1.151%

  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

<Callout title="Note" type="warn">
  You will get different interest rate if you use nper 20 and yearly PMT be 2856
  x 12. This is because the earlier solution compounds monthly, and this one
  compounds yearly.

<Callout title="Question Time!" type="info">
  If you have yearly interest rate of 4%, how much can you get yearly?
</Callout>

<Accordions>

  <Accordion title="Answer Walkthrough">
    1. Let PV be -612000.<br/>

     2. Nper (Number of periods) is 240 months.<br/>
     3. Future Value is 0 - you used up all your retirement funds at 85 years
     4. Your monthly interest rate is 0.333% (4% / 12 months)

You can use the PMT function to calculate the amount you can get monthly. ($3708.60)

<Callout title="Question Time!" type="info">
  If you can earn 4% annualized return, how much money do you need to retire?
</Callout>

<Accordions>

  <Accordion title="Answer Walkthrough">

     1. Nper (Number of periods) is 240 months.<br/>
     2. Future Value is 0 - you used up all your retirement funds at 85 years
     3. Your monthly interest rate is 0.333% (4% / 12 months)
     4. Your pmt (monthly) is still $2856 from first question.
     5. You can use the PV formula to calculate. You end up with -$471,302.43
