<Callout title="Why Learn this?" type="info">
  1. You will learn if an insurance plan is scamming you or do you actually
  stand to earn from it <br />
  2. Learn if you should actually invest in a company/investment

### Net Present Value (NPV)

NPV is the difference between the market value of a project and its cost.

<Callout title="Note" type="info">
  This is different from present value! NPV represents the value created,
  present value can be high but indicate a loss.
</Callout>

Investment Procedure:

<Steps>
  <Step>Estimate all your expected future cash flows</Step>
  <Step>
    Estimate the required return of projects at your risk level/ interest/
    discount rate
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Find the present value of the cash flow and subtract the initial investment,
    which gives you NPV
  </Step>
</Steps>

**_If NPV is positive, take the investment!_**

<Callout title="What is Decision Rule?" type="info">
  It's your criteria for the investment. For example, if you would like to
  breakeven **_within 2 years_**, that is your decision rule.
</Callout>

<Callout title="Question Time!" type="info">
  You are reviewing a new project and have estimated the following cash flows:
  1. Year 0: Cash Flow(CF) = -\$165,000
  2. Year 1: Cash Flow(CF) = -\$63,120. Net Income (NI) = \$13,620
  3. Year 2: Cash Flow(CF) = -\$70,800. Net Income (NI) = \$3,300
  4. Year 3: Cash Flow(CF) = -\$91,080. Net Income (NI) = \$29,100
  5. Average Book Value = \$72,000
  6. Required return for assets of this risk level is 12%.

</Callout>
<Callout title="Note" type="info">
Go through the answer walkthrough, then do yourself. Use google sheets/ excel, if you have financial calculator try it.
</Callout>

Here are the links to some excel formulas for this lecture if you need it

- [NPV](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/npv-function-8672cb67-2576-4d07-b67b-ac28acf2a568) - Value creation from a series of cash flows
- [IRR](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/irr-function-64925eaa-9988-495b-b290-3ad0c163c1bc) - Calculates the return needed to break even from a bunch of cash flows

<Accordions>

  <Accordion title="Answer Walkthrough">
  After you have copied all the question information into excel, you can use the NPV formula to get NPV. NPV(12%, cash flows from Year 1 to 3) + Year 0 cash flow = \$12,627.41
  <Callout title="Why can't I select all cash flows with NPV formula?" type="info">
The excel formula is not built in to include the Y0 cash flow. If you select Year 0 to Year 3 with NPV formula, you get \$11,274 which is incorrect. You can verify this with a financial calculator or see my calculator walkthrough below.

Decision Rule - You want to earn money from taking this project.

**_Since NPV >0, there is value creation. You take the project!_**

</Accordions>

It is important to understand the purpose of the financial ratio. Please go through these accordions.

<Accordions>

  <Accordion title="Does NPV account for time value of money?">
  Yes, because you are discounting the cash flows.
  </Accordion> 
  <Accordion title="Does NPV account for the risk of the cash flows?">
  Yes. If the interest/ discount rate is higher, then the risk is higher; vice versa.
  </Accordion> 
  <Accordion title="Does the NPV rule provide an indication about the increase in value??">
  Yes. It shows how much value we add on top of the cost
  </Accordion> 
  <Accordion title="Should we consider the NPV rule for our primary decision rule?">
  Yes. It accounts for the value creation of the investment/ company.
  </Accordion> 
</Accordions>

### Payback period

This represents how long it takes for you to get back your initial investment. In this question, your investment was \$165,000 at year 0 (remember negative sign = money leaves you). Now, lets try to find the payback period for this question.

<Accordions>

<Accordion title="Answer Walkthrough">
Do take note of the sign when calculating the payback period. A negative sign indicates that you have already earned your money back, and a positive sign indicates how much money you have **_yet_** to get back.

1.Year 1 Payback period = -(-\$165,000 + \$63,120) = \$101,880 <br/>
2.Year 2 Payback period = \$101880 - \$70,800 = \$31,080<br/>
3.Year 3 Payback period = \$31080 - \$91,080 = -\$60,000

Now recall that payback period is how many years it takes for you to breakeven/ get all your money back. It occurs between year 2 and year 3.

To get the exact amount of time needed, we need to use **_interpolation_**.

Number of years to break even = 2 years + 31080/91080 = 2.341 years

Since decision rule is breakeven in 2 years, reject this project.

### Evaluation of payback period

| Advantages                                  | Disadvantages                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Easy to understand                          | Ignores the time value of money                                                       |
| Adjusts for uncertainty of later cash flows | Requires an arbitrary cutoff point                                                    |
| Biased toward liquidity                     | Ignores cash flows beyond the cutoff date                                             |
|                                             | Biased against long-term projects, such as research and development, and new projects |

The most glaring problem with using payback period is that there is a time cost in waiting to get \$70,800 at year 2 (discount value). You could have invested that \$70,800 elsewhere at year 0 and end up with say \$72,000!

### Introducing - discounted payback period (DPP)!

<Accordions>

<Accordion title="Answer Walkthrough">
This one is pretty complicated, so you might need to read for awhile.

1. Year 1 DPP = \$165,000 - \$63,120 / (1+0.12) = \$108,642.8<br/>

<Callout title="What is going on?" type="info">
  You are trying to get the **_present value_** of the cash flow you receive at
  Year 1 (\$63,120). Hence, you discount it by the required return rate, which
  is 12%.
</Callout>
2. Year 2 DPP = \$108,642 - \$70,800/(1+0.12)$^2$ = \$52,201.53 <br />
3. Year 3 DPP = \$52,201.53 - \$91,080/(1+0.12)$^3$ = -\$12627.41436

So, you can expect to break even using DPP between year 2 and year 3. To find the exact time needed, you apply interpolation once again:

Number of years to break even = 2 years + \$52,201 / (\$91,080 / (1+0.12)$^3$) = 2.80 years

<Callout title="What is going on?" type="info">
  You have to discount the cashflow you are receiving when you are interpolating
  too! 2 + \$31,080 / \$91,080 gives you 2.57 years, which is wrong.
</Callout>

Since decision rule is breakeven in 2 years, reject this project.

</Accordion>
</Accordions>

<Callout title="More notes" type="info">
  1. You may have noticed that DPP end value is same as NPV, just different
  signs. They are the same, provided that you are taking into account all cash
  flows and not limiting DPP to say year 2 due to your decision rule. <br />
  2. Number of years needed to breakeven with DPP calculation will always be more
  than that of payback period. This is because you are accounting for the discount
  rate for the cash flows.
</Callout>

| Does not accept negative estimated NPV investments when all future cash flows are positive | Ignores cash flows beyond the cutoff point                      |
| Biased towards liquidity                                                                   | Biased against long-term projects, such as R&D and new products |

It is important to understand the purpose of the financial ratio. Please go through these accordions.

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Does DPP account for time value of money?">
    Discounted payback accounts for time value of money.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Does DPP account for the risk of the cash flows?">
    Yes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Does the (discounted) payback rule provide an indication about the increase in value?">
    No, that is NPV. DPP only accounts for it when it is the last DPP, i.e. it
    accounts for all cash flows.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Should we consider the DPP rule for our primary decision rule?">
    Depends. NPV will account for all cash flows and guarantee you confirm earn.
    Discounted payback is when you want to breakeven within 2 years. So an
    investment may not allow you to breakeven in 2 years, but it can give you
    very high profits over 30 years (high NPV).
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

### Internal Rate Of Return (IRR)

IRR represents the required rate of return needed for you to break even, taking into account all the cash flows.

If IRR is lower than required rate of return, you reject the project.

<Accordions>

<Accordion title="Answer Walkthrough">
Just do IRR(all cash flows). You get 16%.
Since 16% > 12%, you accept the project.

<Callout title="Understanding the reason for accepting" type="info">
We have established through NPV calculation that this project will generate profit. 16% discount rate is what's needed to cause this project to generate 0 profits. Hence the rule for IRR is reject project if IRR < the required return / discount rate.
</Callout>

</Accordion>
</Accordions>

<Callout title="Food For Thought" type="info">
  Is there a formula to calculate the required rate of return, based on a
  specific year? I will leave that up to you / some finance expert reading this
  to figure it out!
</Callout>

### Average Accounting Return

$\text{Average Accounting Return} = \frac{\text{Average Net Income}}{\text{Average Book Value}}$

Honestly, this is a pretty useless ratio.If you are worried about the direction of the company **_without any cash flow data_**, then use this.
