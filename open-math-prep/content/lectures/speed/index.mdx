## Speed, Distance, and Time Formulas

| Quantity | Formula   | Variables                         |
| -------- | --------- | --------------------------------- |
| Speed    | S = D / T | S = speed, D = distance, T = time |
| Distance | D = S Ã— T | D = distance, S = speed, T = time |
| Time     | T = D / S | T = time, D = distance, S = speed |

## Common Unit Conversions

### Time

| Conversion         | Formula         |
| ------------------ | --------------- |
| Hours to minutes   | 1 h = 60 min    |
| Hours to seconds   | 1 h = 3600 s    |
| Minutes to seconds | 1 min = 60 s    |
| Days to hours      | 1 day = 24 h    |
| Weeks to days      | 1 week = 7 days |

### Length

| Conversion            | Formula       |
| --------------------- | ------------- |
| Meters to centimeters | 1 m = 100 cm  |
| Kilometers to meters  | 1 km = 1000 m |
| Millimeters to meters | 1000 mm = 1 m |

### Speed

| Conversion  | Formula               |
| ----------- | --------------------- |
| km/h to m/s | 1 km/h = 0.277778 m/s |
| m/s to km/h | 1 m/s = 3.6 km/h      |

Note: For precise calculations, use more decimal places where necessary. Try to calculate it yourself, no need to memorise.
