Equal Fractions is one of the most important concepts. It is required to understand concepts like constant difference, repeated identity and constant total.

### Scenario

Lets say you are a perfectionist. You have a chocolate cake that is sliced into 2 parts, and a strawberry cake that is sliced into 3 parts. On every bite, you want to eat
an equal amount of chocolate cake and strawberry cake! How do you do that??

<div className="flex flex-wrap space-between">
  <EqualPartPieChartComponent title={"Chocolate Cake"} slices={2} />
  <EqualPartPieChartComponent title={"Strawberry Cake"} slices={3} />
</div>

If you take 1 slice per bite, you end up with 1 slice of strawberry cake leftover.

### Solution

Cut the cakes up until they have equal slices!

<div className="steps">

<div className="step">
<h3>Find the lowest common multiple of 2 and 3</h3>

<p>2 x 3 = 6</p>
</div>
</div>

<div className="flex flex-wrap space-between">
  <EqualPartPieChartComponent title={"Chocolate Cake"} slices={6} />
  <EqualPartPieChartComponent title={"Strawberry Cake"} slices={6} />
</div>

Now, you can take 1 slice at a time, and finish both cakes in 6 bites!

The key to identifying a equal fraction concept is to identify what may be the same across multiple ratios and fractions.
