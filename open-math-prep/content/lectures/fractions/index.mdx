  It is highly recommended that you watch the videos, especially if you have
  been relying on your calculator. It is important you learn how to do
  calculations without a calculator for Paper 1!

### Why do you need to flip the fraction when dividing?

<p>
  Let's say you get 2 dollars from your parents daily to spend at school. How
  many 1 dollar items you can buy?
</p>
<p>2 / 1 = 2.</p>
<p>Now, what if you want to buy 50 cent items? 50 cents = 1/2 a dollar.</p>
<p>When you do 2 รท (1/2), you are asking: How many 1/2s can fit in 2?</p>
Remember, when we divide by a fraction, we're asking "How many of these small pieces fit into our big number?" Flipping and multiplying helps us find that answer easily!
