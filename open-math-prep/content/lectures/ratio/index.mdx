### Intro to Ratio

<Youtube id={"xA435umOQuw"} />

For ratio word problems, 90% of the time it is either repeated identity/ constant total/ constant difference. the recommended approach is:

1. Find what is the common thing (age difference? person A? Total?)
2. Make the common thing equal (equal fractions/ common multiple)
3. Find the answer
