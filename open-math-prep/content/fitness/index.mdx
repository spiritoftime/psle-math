### Introduction

Truthfully, I have no idea about fitness as of the creation of this article ^^. There is definitely a plethora of online resources out there too. However, perhaps the full story from a newbie and proper advice may be useful to some people? (just like futureCanoe hehe)

About my fitness experience: I did train at secondary school and during NS, but I've had to quit both times because I've had improper form, especially during deadlift and squat. I've injured my lower back and knees multiple times. I dont know how to meal prep. I'm pretty fit in that I can do pushups and stuff, but nothing too crazy (struggle to pass IPPT, especially 2.4km every year^^)

As of recently (14/10/2024), I signed up for a gym membership under BFT, Yishun and had my very first session. Honestly, at the time of writing this (23/10/2024), I have no idea what's going on, I just show up and listen to the trainers. However, I will try to show up from Monday to Saturday week, I will try to talk more, make new gym friends and hopefully make these knowledge mine^^

The most important thing for fitness is probably consistency. There's a million motivational videos out there, but I guess the only way I can try to motivate you is to lead by example ^^. Hence, I will try (as of 23/10/2024) to document my fitness journey!
